# Git_Tutorials
This is my Git Repo.

First change made to Readme.md 
# skipping one line and then writing to next line automatically pushes the new text to new line. 
# if we directly write text in new line then it is not pushed to new line rather saved in same line.
# for this we use <br> tag to go to new line

Third Change<br>
